This application is capable of solving a really common problem.

By the use of this application the user/client of the insurance company
can fill the form avoiding the time taken by the insurer to be present to
that location.

The user can take 2 pictures an up-close to the damage and another picture
from a bit far away so the plates and both cars will be shown.

These pictures will be send to a visual recognition A.I. which will then
score the pictures depending if they are truly pictures of cars that have
had a collision or damage in any sort.

With the use of the IBM Watson Visual recognition tool we can make sure
that the pictures taken are from an actual car accident and they have to be
considered.

This will happen at the same time as the pictures are taken and before
the pictures are sent to the insurance company and to the people who work there.
Therefore, this will reduce the spam, if any, and the false accusations.
